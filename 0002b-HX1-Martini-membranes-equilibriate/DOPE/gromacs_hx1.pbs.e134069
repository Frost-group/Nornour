Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used
Using 64 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 3.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 60%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.1%.


NOTE: 6 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      14 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
