# The original dataset was cleaned by only taking the AMPs with MIC values corresponding to p.aeruginosa bacteria
# The following rules were applied to sort the dataset:
# 1. Only peptides with canonical AA were kept
# 2. When multiple values of MIC where given, the average value was taken
# 3. When an uncertainty on the MIC value was given, it was removed to simplify the sorting process
# 4. All the MIC values were converted to ÂµM

# This gives a dataset of 728 AMP's with MIC values against p.aeruginosa
